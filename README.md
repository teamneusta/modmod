# modmod for pw_comments

This extension provides a dashboard widget and a web module to moderate comments for teamneusta/pw_comments.

Obviously you need the teamneusta/pw_comments extension. Other than that you are good to go.


Installing this extension will add a backend module to the web section.
The module will show you both public and hidden comments on a selected page. <br />
You can specify the displayed levels of the page tree, starting with the selected page. This allows for a better overview of comments in larger installations.  

The dashboard widget will show the latest 15 unmoderated (hidden) comments across all pages.

install via composer `composer req teamneusta/modmod`
